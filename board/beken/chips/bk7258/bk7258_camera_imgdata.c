 *
 * BK7258 GC2145 camera platform (imgdata) driver: NuttX V4L2
 * imgdata_ops_s implementation for the YUV_BUF whole-frame direct-capture
 * path.  This is the platform data interface half of the driver split
 * described in the openvela Camera Driver Framework guide; sensor-specific
 * I2C register programming lives in the imgsensor half
 * (board/beken/boards/bk7258/bk7258-ap/src/bk7258_camera_imgsensor.c).
 *
 * Capture model
 * -------------
 * YUV_BUF writes a complete YUV422 frame straight into the V4L2 frame
 * buffer (which imgdata_ops_s.alloc() takes from PSRAM) and raises the
 * YUV_ARV interrupt when the frame is done.  That is the reference
 * implementation's pure-YUV path: bk_avdk_smp
 * ap/components/bk_dvp/src/bk_dvp.c dvp_camera_yuv_mode() points
 * em_base_addr at the frame buffer, and dvp_camera_yuv_eof_handler()
 * (registered on YUV_BUF_YUV_ARV) hands the finished frame up and
 * re-points em_base_addr at the next one.  There is no line-batch
 * ping-pong buffer and no DMA copy in this path -- the previous revision
 * of this driver reconstructed frames from ~60 SM0_WR/SM1_WR line-done
 * interrupts per frame plus one DMA transfer each, which is what the
 * reference only does for the combined YUV+encode formats.
 *
 * Interrupt-context rules
 * -----------------------
 * v4l2_cap.c's complete_capture() runs in interrupt context and, from
 * there, calls back into IMGDATA_SET_BUF() (to re-arm the next buffer)
 * and IMGDATA_STOP_CAPTURE()/IMGSENSOR_STOP_CAPTURE() (when it runs out
 * of vacant containers).  So set_buf() and stop_capture(), not just the
 * frame callback, must be interrupt-safe: no printf(), no blocking, no
 * allocation.  Diagnostics in those functions are guarded by
 * up_interrupt_context().
 *
 * Capture watchdog
 * ----------------
 * VIDIOC_DQBUF blocks in nxsem_wait_uninterruptible() with no timeout
 * (v4l2_cap.c capture_dqbuf()), so if the hardware never completes a
 * frame the caller's dequeue thread never returns -- which is exactly how
 * `nxcamera stream` ended up unable to process its own `q` command
 * (nxcamera_stop() posts VIDEO_MSG_STOP and then blocks in pthread_join()
 * on that thread).  This driver therefore runs a watchdog while capturing
 * and reports an error frame if no YUV_ARV arrives within
 * BK7258_CAMERA_WATCHDOG_MS: complete_capture() completes the buffer with
 * V4L2_BUF_FLAG_ERROR and posts dqbuf_wait_flg, so DQBUF returns, the
 * application loop regains control and a stop request can be honoured.

/* Geometry is not fixed here: whatever the imgsensor half can program, this
 * half must be able to receive.  The accepted geometry therefore comes from
 * the format the framework hands down at VIDIOC_S_FMT, and the only limits
 * this driver imposes are the ones the hardware really has:
 *
 *   - YUV_BUF counts in 8x8 blocks (x_pixel = width / 8), so both
 *     dimensions must be multiples of 8.
 *   - the frame must fit in PSRAM, which set_buf() checks against the
 *     buffer the framework actually allocated.
 *
 * The largest mode the sensor offers is 1600x1200, i.e. 3,840,000 bytes a
 * frame; the PSRAM display pool is 0x570000 (5,701,632) bytes, so that mode
 * admits a single buffer while 1280x720 (1,843,200) admits three.  Which of
 * those the application asks for is its business -- REQBUFS fails cleanly
 * through imgdata_ops_s.alloc() when the pool cannot satisfy it.

/* JPEG capture.
 *
 * The encoded bitstream has no memory-mapped output on this SoC: it leaves
 * the JPEG block through a FIFO register, so a DMA channel has to drain it
 * into the V4L2 buffer (see bk7258_jpeg_enc.h).  The channel runs in REPEAT
 * mode with a looping destination, so one configuration absorbs a whole
 * frame regardless of how big it turns out to be.
 *
 * BK7258_CAMERA_JPEG_CHUNK is the DMA's transfer_len, i.e. how often the
 * finish interrupt fires.  10KB matches the reference's FRAME_BUFFER_CACHE
 * (dvp_private.h); at a typical 30KB frame that is a handful of interrupts
 * per frame, which is cheap enough while still bounding how much of a frame
 * is in flight.
 *
 * The encoder appends 5 CRC bytes after the bitstream (JPEG_CRC_SIZE in
 * hal_jpeg_types.h).  They travel through the FIFO like everything else but
 * are not part of the image, and byte_count_pfrm does not count them --
 * which is why this driver takes byte_count_pfrm as the length and does not
 * subtract anything.
 *
 * BK7258_CAMERA_JPEG_EOI_WINDOW is how far back from that length to look for
 * the FF D9 end-of-image marker.  The reference searches the last 10 bytes
 * and trims to the marker; the same check doubles as proof that the frame
 * arrived whole, so a frame without it is completed as an error rather than
 * handed to the application as a truncated file.
 */

/* Lines of the encoder's input staging area in PSRAM.
 *
 * In JPEG mode YUV_BUF does not write frames; it stages line batches for the
 * encoder to consume, and its frame-buffer register points at that staging
 * area (yuv_buf_hal_set_jpeg_mode_config() writes em_base_addr from
 * config->base_addr, which the reference fills with a buffer of
 * width * 32 * 2 bytes -- bk_camera_dvp_ctlr.c).
 *
 * Pointing that register at the V4L2 buffer instead, as a first attempt did,
 * makes the module write raw pixels straight over the bitstream the DMA is
 * depositing there: the captured file then contains recognisable UYVY data
 * and never starts with FF D8.

/* The JPEG completion thread, and why this driver runs its own instead of
 * using LPWORK.
 *
 * Finishing a hardware JPEG means walking its entropy stream (see
 * bk7258_jpeg_entropy.c), which measured 252 ms per frame on 2026-08-31 --
 * 82 runs totalling 20.7 s inside a 32.6 s session, 63% of the only core
 * this chip schedules on.  On LPWORK that work inherits
 * CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORKPRIORITY, which is 100 here, and 100 is also
 * SCHED_PRIORITY_DEFAULT: the same priority as the velasight UI loop and as
 * nsh_main.  Round robin then split the core four ways in slices of
 * CONFIG_RR_INTERVAL, and one validation run was longer than a whole slice.
 * The visible result was a UI that did not repaint and a console that
 * printed "ps" at roughly one line per 1.75 s against 7.8 ms when idle.
 *
 * 90 puts it below both, so the UI and the shell always preempt it.  The
 * trade is deliberate: under load the validator falls behind and jpeg_hw_busy
 * grows, which drops camera frames.  Dropping frames is the right failure --
 * the session samples at CONFIG_VS_SOCIAL_CAPTURE_FPS, single digits, while a
 * frozen UI has no acceptable version.
 *
 * Lowering CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORKPRIORITY instead would fix this path and break
 * others: LPWORK is shared, in this tree by bk7258_mmcsd.c and
 * bk7258_bt_gatt_test.c and by whatever NuttX's own drivers queue there.
 *
 * The stack matches what this code already ran on (CONFIG_SCHED_LPWORKSTACKSIZE
 * is 8192 in this configuration), so moving it cannot regress depth.

/* Why the encoder is not started on a frame boundary.
 *
 * Every JPEG session begins with exactly err=3 resets=3 short=1 and then
 * runs clean, no matter how long it is (measured at 3, 13 and 33 frames:
 * the counts did not move).  So the errors are a start-up transient, not a
 * per-frame defect.  The reason looked obvious: the reference arms its
 * capture path before it initialises the sensor (bk_dvp.c dvp_camera_init(),
 * step 5 bk_yuv_buf_start(JPEG_MODE) then step 6 sensor->init()), so its
 * encoder always sees a stream that starts at a frame boundary, whereas this
 * driver leaves the sensor streaming from init (bk7258_camera_imgsensor.c)
 * and therefore enables the encoder at an arbitrary phase -- and a partial
 * frame is exactly what the encoder reports as frame_err (the reference
 * names that handler dvp_camera_sensor_ppi_err_handler, i.e. "the picture is
 * not the size I was told").
 *
 * Waiting for one VSYNC before bk7258_jpeg_enc_start() was tried and does
 * not work, because the premise is circular: in JPEG mode the VSYNC events
 * only start once the encoder is enabled.  yuv_mode is off in this mode
 * (see bk7258_yuv_buf_start_jpeg()), so until the JPEG block runs there is
 * no sync detection to report a boundary.  Measured: the wait timed out in
 * all three sessions, and the only effect was the wait itself -- a 30-frame
 * session went from 29.72 to 25.99 fps (elapsed 1110ms -> 1231ms).
 *
 * The transient is harmless where it matters: it is absorbed before the
 * application sees anything.  A frame without an EOI is completed with an
 * error and never handed up, so the first frame an application dequeues is
 * a whole one -- measured across three sessions, frame 0 came back with
 * bytesused 13079 / 13147 / 13111, SOI and EOI present, flags 0.  That is
 * what matters for packages/ai_agent, whose camera_capture tool takes
 * exactly one frame.
 *
 * Eliminating it for real means giving the sensor a stream on/off that
 * start_capture() can sequence against, which is a change to the imgsensor
 * side and to the already-validated UYVY path.  Not worth it for three
 * absorbed errors.

/* The bytes the prefix walk actually reads, in SRAM, and the reason this

 *
 * jpeg_validate_scratch comes from kmm_malloc(), and the error message for a
 * failed allocation says "no internal RAM" -- which was the intent, not a
 * guarantee.  bk7258_psram.c adds 6 MB of PSRAM to the same heap with
 * kmm_addregion() and says so plainly in its own comment: "mm has no way to
 * steer allocations".  CONFIG_BUILD_FLAT means one heap; .bss already holds
 * 320 of the 336 KB of SRAM (the IOB pool alone is 92 KB, LVGL's is 64 KB),
 * so the heap that request lands in is PSRAM, mapped non-cacheable.  Every
 * byte the Huffman decoder reads is then an uncached bus transaction.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-03, 480x480, VALIDATE_MCUS=128, 75 frames: the scratch
 * memcpy cost 16291532 cycles per frame and the prefix walk 37206069, which
 * at the 481 MHz the cycle counter implies is 33.9 ms and 77.4 ms.  111 ms of
 * the validator's 112 ms went to those two, against the 1-4 ms the same code
 * measures with its input in SRAM.  Per byte the walk was 30 times more
 * expensive than the memcpy over the same memory, because a bit reader loads
 * single bytes where memcpy moves words.
 *
 * The walk only needs a prefix -- 128 macroblocks of 1800 at this size, about
 * 1.9 KB of the 26 KB stream -- so the fix is to put that much in SRAM rather
 * than the whole frame.  4 KB is a little over twice the measured need and
 * fits in what .bss has left.  A frame whose prefix does not fit, or that
 * needs a bit shift applied, falls back to the PSRAM scratch and pays the old
 * price; jpeg_prefix_miss counts how often that happens, so the size can be
 * revisited from data rather than guessed at again.

 *
 *   CONFIG_BK7258_CAMERA_JPEG_FPS stays what its help text says it is -- an
 *   upper bound, defaulting to the rate the encoder can actually reach, so a
 *   build never throttles itself below the hardware.  What was missing is the
 *   other half of that argument: it says sampling "belongs to whoever is
 *   uploading", but the interval such a caller passes was accepted by the
 *   framework and then discarded here, so the only way to sample slower was
 *   to lower the ceiling for every application in the image.
 *
 *   That mattered once social mode existed.  It wants a few frames a second
 *   and paces its own dequeues accordingly, but the pacing was on the wrong
 *   side of the driver: every frame this module delivers costs a copy out of
 *   the drain ring plus, on the hardware path, a full 4:2:2 Huffman
 *   validation over non-cacheable PSRAM, and it was paying that at the
 *   ceiling rate while reading a fraction of the result.  Lowering the
 *   ceiling instead would have taken web_tool's live preview down with it,
 *   because both are the same /dev/video0 and the ceiling is one build-wide
 *   constant.
 *
 *   Zero or nonsense means "no request": the framework seeds the interval
 *   from the sensor's default and a caller that never issues VIDIOC_S_PARM
 *   should keep the behaviour it had.  A request above the ceiling is capped
 *   rather than refused, because the ceiling is a statement about the
 *   hardware and no caller can argue with it.

 *     2. Stop the channel, so nothing more is written while the buffer is
 *        handed over.
 *     3. Take the length from byte_count_pfrm, which the hardware counted
 *        while encoding.
 *     4. Confirm the frame ends in FF D9 and trim to it.  This is the one
 *        cheap check that the bitstream really arrived whole; a frame
 *        without it is reported as an error rather than passed off as a
