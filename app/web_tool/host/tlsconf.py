"""The TLS identity this console presents, and how both peers check it.

Two hops, both TLS, both terminating here:

    browser  --HTTPS/WSS-->  console.py  <--TLS 1.2--  web_tool on the board

The same certificate is used for both, because it identifies one thing: this
console process.  It is self-signed, and each peer authenticates it in the way
that actually works for that peer:

  browser   the operator accepts it once (or imports it); a self-signed
            certificate cannot be made to validate without a CA, and pretending
            otherwise by disabling warnings would be worse than the warning
  board     pins the SHA-256 of the DER in kvdb as `web.fp`, and refuses to
            connect when nothing is pinned

Pinning is what makes the board's side real rather than decorative.  The board
has no RTC and no CA bundle: a chain check would either fail or -- as the
upstream agent does by forcing the clock to 2026 -- be theatre.  A fingerprint
needs neither a clock nor a CA.

The key is EC P-256, not RSA.  Two measured reasons: RSA-2048 key generation
does not finish on this part, and ECDHE-ECDSA is the cheap key exchange (a full
DHE-2048 handshake measured 541 ms on this board, of which ~460 ms was
computation).  See docs/2026-08-17-TLS性能核查.md.

The key is generated once into host/tls/ and reused, so the fingerprint the
operator pins stays valid across restarts.  Delete that directory to roll it,
and re-pin afterwards.
